A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. 
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

Getting the names of the tables

SELECT name 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where type = 'table'
 
name
crime_scene_report
drivers_license
facebook_event_checkin
interview
get_fit_now_member
get_fit_now_check_in
solution
income
person

The structure of the crime_scene_report table

SELECT sql 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where name = 'crime_scene_report'
 
sql
crime_scene_report ( date integer, type text, description text, city text )


Now I know the table I need and it's structure time to poke around the data

Select * FROM crime_scene_report

date      type     description                                          city
20180115  robbery  A Man Dressed as Spider-Man Is on a Robbery Spree    NYC
20180115  murder   Life? Dont talk to me about life                     Albany
20180115  murder   Mama, I killed a man, put a gun against his head...  Reno


We know the crime was a Murder on Jan 15 2018 in SQL City to let's filter these results

Select * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE city = 'SQL City' and date = 20180115

date       type     description                                                                  city
20180115   assault  Hamilton: Lee, do you yield? Burr: You shot him in the side! Yes he yields!  SQL City
20180115   assault  Report Not Found                                                             SQL City
20180115   murder   Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses.                          SQL City
                    The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
                    The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".


Going to the Persons table and getting Annebels info

Select * FROM person
WHERE name LIKE '%Annabel%'
AND
address_street_name LIKE '%Franklin Ave%'

id      name             license_id   address_number   address_street_name   ssn
16371   Annabel Miller   490173       103              Franklin Ave          318771143


Now getting the info for the person at the last house on Northwester Dr

Select * FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE '%Northwestern Dr%'
ORDER BY address_number DESC;

id      name             license_id   address_number   address_street_name   ssn
14887   Morty Schapiro   118009       4919             Northwestern Dr       111564949


Now we have the ID of the witnesses we can grab their interviews from the interview table

Select * FROM interview 
WHERE person_id = '16371'
or person_id = '14887'

person_id   transcript
14887       I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
            The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. 
            The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
         
16371       I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

Now we know quite a bit. 
The murderer is a man with a Gold Membership at Get Fit Now gym with his membership number starting with '48Z' and his licsence plate includes 'H42W'
He was also at the gym the same time as ID:16371 on Jan 9th

Checking the get_fit_now_check_in we can begin finding who we're looking for

Select * FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id LIKE '%48Z%'
AND
check_in_date = '20180109'
GROUP BY membership_id

membership_id   check_in_date   check_in_time   check_out_time
48Z55           20180109        1530            1700
48Z7A           20180109        1600            1730

We now have just two suspects

Plugging this info into the member tables gives us names

Select * FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE id LIKE '48Z55'
OR
id LIKE '48Z7A'

id      person_id   name            membership_start_date   membership_status
48Z7A   28819       Joe Germuska    20160305                gold
48Z55   67318       Jeremy Bowers   20160101                gold

Now let's see who has 'H42W' in their liscence plate

To do this we have to grab their license_id and then use that to get their plate number

Select * FROM person
WHERE id LIKE '28819'
OR
id LIKE '67318'

id      name            license_id   address_number   address_street_name     ssn
28819   Joe Germuska    173289       111              Fisk Rd                 138909730
67318   Jeremy Bowers   423327       530              Washington Pl, Apt 3A   871539279


Now to use those license_id to find who has 'H42W' in their plate

Select * FROM drivers_license
WHERE id LIKE '173289'
OR
id LIKE '423327'

This only brings back one result
id       age   height   eye_color   hair_color   gender   plate_number   car_make    car_model
423327   30    70       brown       brown        male     0H42W2         Chevrolet   Spark LS

Matching that ID back gives us, 
Jeremy Bowers who has H42W in his plate and he is a gold member at get fit gym and was there the same date as the witness

Checking Solution
