A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. 
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

Getting the names of the tables

SELECT name 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where type = 'table'
 
name
crime_scene_report
drivers_license
facebook_event_checkin
interview
get_fit_now_member
get_fit_now_check_in
solution
income
person


The structure of the crime_scene_report table

SELECT sql 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where name = 'crime_scene_report'
 
sql
crime_scene_report ( date integer, type text, description text, city text )

Now I know the table I need and it's structure time to poke around the data

Select * FROM crime_scene_report

date      type     description                                          city
20180115  robbery  A Man Dressed as Spider-Man Is on a Robbery Spree    NYC
20180115  murder   Life? Dont talk to me about life                     Albany
20180115  murder   Mama, I killed a man, put a gun against his head...  Reno

We know the crime was a Murder on Jan 15 2018 in SQL City to let's filter these results

Select * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE city = 'SQL City' and date = 20180115

date       type     description                                                                  city
20180115   assault  Hamilton: Lee, do you yield? Burr: You shot him in the side! Yes he yields!  SQL City
20180115   assault  Report Not Found                                                             SQL City
20180115   murder   Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses.                          SQL City
                    The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
                    The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".



Going to the Persons table and getting Annebels info

Select * FROM person
WHERE name LIKE '%Annabel%'
AND
address_street_name LIKE '%Franklin Ave%'

id      name             license_id   address_number   address_street_name   ssn
16371   Annabel Miller   490173       103              Franklin Ave          318771143

Now getting the info for the person at the last house on Northwester Dr

Select * FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE '%Northwestern Dr%'
ORDER BY address_number DESC;

id      name             license_id   address_number   address_street_name   ssn
14887   Morty Schapiro   118009       4919             Northwestern Dr       111564949
