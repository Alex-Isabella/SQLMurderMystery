A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. 
The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

Getting the names of the tables

SELECT name 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where type = 'table'
 
name
crime_scene_report
drivers_license
facebook_event_checkin
interview
get_fit_now_member
get_fit_now_check_in
solution
income
person


The structure of the crime_scene_report table

SELECT sql 
  FROM sqlite_master
 where name = 'crime_scene_report'
 
sql
crime_scene_report ( date integer, type text, description text, city text )

Now I know the table I need and it's structure time to poke around the data

Select * FROM crime_scene_report

date      type     description                                          city
20180115  robbery  A Man Dressed as Spider-Man Is on a Robbery Spree    NYC
20180115  murder   Life? Dont talk to me about life                     Albany
20180115  murder   Mama, I killed a man, put a gun against his head...  Reno

We know the crime was a Murder on Jan 15 2018 in SQL City to let's filter these results

Select * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE city = 'SQL City' and date = 20180115
